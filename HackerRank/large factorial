# Function Description

# Complete the extraLongFactorials function in the editor below. It should print the result and return.

# extraLongFactorials has the following parameter(s):

# n: an integer
# Note: Factorials of  can't be stored even in a  long long variable. Big integers 
# must be used for such calculations. Languages like Java, Python, Ruby etc. can handle big integers, 
# but we need to write additional code in C/C++ to handle huge values.
